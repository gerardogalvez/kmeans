# K-means clustering for image compression.
Octave implementation of K-means applied to image compression, where the number of clusters (K) is the amount of colors the resulting image will have.

Feel free to try it out with an image of your own, but make sure it isn't to big since K-means runs for K = 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, thus it can take a long time to finish.
